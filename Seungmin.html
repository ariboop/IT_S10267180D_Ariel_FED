             He initially dreamed of becoming a baseball player but he had to stop because of an injury and other problems.
             Still, he liked singing ever since he was little. In the fourth grade of elementary school, he went to a nursery
             rhyme contest, won a prize, and joined a choir. In middle school, when he was thinking about what he should do 
             to be happy in life, he thought about "music", so he studied and practiced singing to appeal to his parents.<br/><br/>He
             learned English when he went to Los Angeles for 3 months.<br/><br/>He graduated from Cheongdam High School on February 14
             , 2019.<br/><br/>Around 2020, Seungmin scouted for his own vocal teacher outside of JYP Entertainment to improve his 
             singing skills and started attending the classes of Voice Tuning.<br/><br/>On May 8, 2023, he was invited to throw the
             first pitch for the Lotte Giants in Busan, but the match was cancelled because of bad weather.<br/><br/>On March 18, 2024, he threw the first pitch for 
            the exhibition match between Team Korea and Los Angeles Dodgers at the Gocheok Sky Dome.

            PuppyM is Seungmin's Skzoo. PuppyM's design was inspired by Seungmin's puppy like persona and facial features paired with
            the fact that the members tend to refer to him as a puppy as well.  A dandy puppy is Seungmin's animal because it fits 
            charming face and personality.
