        <h2 class="head" class="box" style="color:#A6DED9;">Personal Life</h2>
        <p class="head" class="box" style="font-size: large;">
            Lee Min-ho was born on October 25, 1998 in Gimpo, South Korea. He grew up in Daegot-myeon.<br/><br/>He adopted his first cat 
            Soonie in 2011 and his second cat Doongie around 2013.<br/><br/>When he was in middle school, he watched a dance video and 
            found it cool. He tried to dance in front of the mirror and thought he was good at it, so he asked his mother if he could take 
            dance classes, and she approved. He joined Souldance Studio in Seoul and stayed there for five years, attending classes 
            like Bico Lim's.<br/><br/>While dancing and completing his education, he had several part time jobs in order to pay transport 
            fares and cram schools, such as handing out flyers, teaching at a dance academy, and working in a barbeque restaurant.<br/>
            <br/>He graduated from Gimpo Jeil Technical High School in computer sciences. He passed an entrance exam at the Chugye 
            University For The Arts with a self choreography and joined the campus on March 2017. He kept attending even after 
            debuting, but left at some point.<br/><br/>He adopted his third cat, Dori, in February 2019.<br/><br/>He is currently 
            enrolled at Gukje Cyber University under the Department of Entertainment Studies.<br/><br/>In November 2023, he participated 
            in the "Love Your W" campaign by W Korea to raise awareness about breast cancer.<br/><br/>On February 29, 2024, it was 
            announced that Lee Know had donated 100 million won to World Vision's "Global Hunger Crisis Response" project to help 
            children face food shortages in the poorest countries, and was appointed as a member of the "Bob Pierce" donors club.

        <h2 class="head" class="box" style="color:#A6DED9;">Dance</h2>
        <p class="head" class="box" style="font-size: large;">
            Lee Know's main dance genre (and his favorite) is hip-hop. Earlier, he had a recognizable style of the Souldance Studio he 
            studied at. His dancing is characterized by a neat isolation of body parts and the way his movements follow the beat neatly. 
            His style is best showcased on songs that require precise yet hip movements such as "Easy" and "Super Bowl". Thanks to his 
            background in martial arts, he is sometimes in charge of performing stunts, especially during Kingdom: Legendary War stages 
            and in the song "S-Class".<br/><br/>Lee Know is also called the group's "dance leader" by Bang Chan since debut. Due to his 
            professional background in dancing, he helps the other members with getting the choreography right during practice. He is 
            also involved in choreography, and choreographed his solo dance video "DAWN" and the group's 2018 MAMA FANS' CHOICE in JAPAN 
            performance.

        <h2 class="head" class="box" style="color:#A6DED9;">Vocals and Rap</h2>
        <p class="head" class="box" style="font-size: large;">
            Lee Know is mainly considered as a vocalist. He is especially known for his falsettos, showcased in "Levanter" and "TASTE". 
            However, he was always midway between a rapper and vocalist. Even though he never had an official rap role, J.Y. Park asked 
            him to take rap parts during the survival show as he deemed his voice too weak for singing due to the lack of a training 
            period.<br/><br/>In the line distribution, he thus has flexibles lines, sometimes rapping (verse, chorus) and sometimes 
            singing (pre-chorus, bridge). Some rap parts he did became some of his most famous lines, like his introductory rap in 
            "Boxer".
        <br/>
        <h2 class="head" class="box" style="color:#A6DED9;">Visuals</h2>
        <img id="Visual" src="Images/visuallk.jpg" class="small" style="width:25%;">
        <p class="smallright" class="box" style="font-size: large;vertical-align: 100px;">
            Lee Know is part of the visual line along Hyunjin and Felix. He is nicknamed "Unreachable Visual" since debut thanks to his 
            sharp features like his eyes and nose, but also an overall softness to his looks which makes him fit into the "flower boy" 
            archetype. Animals he is associated with are the cat and the bunny.

        <p class="small" class="box" style="font-size: large;vertical-align: 20px;width:35%;margin-left: 15%;">
            Lee Min-ho pursued dancing professionally. He part of two dance teams within Souldance: Cupcakes and Browniebros. In 2016, he 
            performed at World of Dance as a front row guest with Cupcakes. Around the same time, he became a backup dancer for BTS, 
            from the songs "Fire" to "Spring Day" and participated in the "Wings Tour" in early 2017. During his backup dancing 
            career, he realized that he wanted to stand at the center of the stage, so he became a singer.<br/><br/>Minho had auditioned 
            for JYP Entertainment back in 2015 after being noticed during a global dance event, but he didnt hear from them and thought 
            he had failed. He continued his life as a dancer, until he was finally called back two years later. He joined JYPE on 
            July 15, 2017, making the last member of Stray Kids to join the lineup.<br/><br/>His individual picture and name were 
            officially revealed for his participation in the upcoming survival show Stray Kids. He was introduced with the role 
            "Dance". During the show, he was eliminated on episode 4 because he lacked confidence and made mistakes while rapping. 
            Through the audience voting in favor of the 
            9-member group over the 7-member group, it was then confirmed that Min-ho would debut with the boy group Stray Kids.

            Leebit is Lee Know's skzoo. Leebit's design was inspired by Lee Know's front teeth, similar to that of a bunny, 
            with a tough look conveying Lee Know's mischievous persona.
