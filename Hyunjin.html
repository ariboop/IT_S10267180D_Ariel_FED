        <p class="head" class="box" style="font-size: large;">
            Hyunjin's dancing is known for its theatricality and control over his body movements and facial expressions. He showcases two distinct 
            dancing styles, switching swiftly and seamlessly from a fluid and relaxed style to a jerky and sharp style. He always gives his own 
            flair to the group's choreographies and easily draws attention. As such, he has become a key element for the performance aspect of 
            the group.<br/><br/>Hyunjin is also involved in choreography, especially for his solo dance covers such as "Play With Fire". He also 
            gives his input when it comes to the group's live performances. He participated in arranging the stage for the group version of "Red 
            Lights" and suggested to perform "GET LIT" at 2023 Asian Artist Awards to showcase something new.

        <p class="head" class="box" style="font-size: large;">
            In the line distribution, Hyunjin is mainly in charge of rap-based parts. Even though his voice is usually high, he has a signature 
            lazy, low voice rapping which is showcased on songs like "VENOM", "Muddy Water" and "Chk Chk Boom". He often gets verses and choruses.
            Since 2021, Hyunjin got into songwriting and works a lot with Bang Chan to make demos, and since 2022, he started releasing solo 
            SKZ-RECORD songs to showcase his own artistry. He likes writing songs about love and crushes.
        </p>

            he is characterized by long horizontal eyes, thick lips, and a sharp jawline, often called "ice prince" or "chic" type of 
            visuals.<br/><br/>Since 2020 he has been showing off trendy looks carried by a signature long hair, notably blonde or black. 
            A large amount of people, including himself, prefering long over short hair. Since then, he rarely ever cuts his hair short.
            <br/><br/>When he smiles, he looks much rounder and softer, which has given his nickname "Dumpling". Animals he is associated 
            to are the llama, the weasel and the ferret.

        <p class="small" class="box" style="font-size: large;vertical-align: 0px">
            While he was on a shopping trip with his mother in middle school, Hyunjin was scouted by JYP Entertainment to become a 
            trainee. He then joined JYPE without any skill and trained for two years. As a rookie, he got interested in dancing 
            by watching the senior trainees performing on stage, and practiced more by studying various types of dance at the School of 
            Performing Arts (SOPA).<br/><br/>His individual picture and name were officially revealed for his participation in the upcoming 
            survival show Stray Kids. He was introduced with the roles "Rap" and "Dance". On the final episode of the show on December 19,

            Jiniret is Hyunjin's skzoo. Jiniret's design was inspired by Hyunjin's resemblance with a ferret in his facial features, height, and for his fluid
