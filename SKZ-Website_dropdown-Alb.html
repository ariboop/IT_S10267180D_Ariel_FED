                The title track, "Back Door," is like an invitation to come in and join them if you want to continue enjoying the excitement of their previous song, "God's Menu". The song utilizes various instruments such as acoustic and synth to create a festival atmosphere, and unique musical devices in the middle of the song make it more colorful. The choreography, which is reminiscent of playing riverboat, makes it easy and fun for global fans to follow along. The costumes, which are a modern interpretation of traditional hanbok, show off the exquisite oriental beauty, making it even more fun to watch.

                After standing on the edge of adulthood, the boys finally take their first steps into the adult world. And quite boldly at that. Their steps are bold and their eyes are full of confidence. They know the harshness of the new world, but in the eyes of the ambitious boys who have just taken their first steps into society, hardships and adversity are insignificant. This album reveals the courage and challenge of nine boys who dive in fearlessly without worrying about failure, which can be said to be the privilege of those who live with hope.

                Stray Kids had showen their innocence and wildness previously. They finally step into the labyrinth and unfold a "raw story" that blossoms with endless possibilities. Stray Kids chose to go their own way with a burning determination and passion. They just stepped out of the boundaries of adulthood, armed with the honesty to express their emotional processes, and the recklessness to face hardships and adversity without shying away from them. Their choices, challenges and the "side effects" of chaos that come with them may seem harsh but they are more pure than anything.

                The title track, "Thunderous," uses the dual meanings of "naggers" who make noise and "yellers" who make music in one word, expressing the message that they will never give in to the nagging of others and will say what they need to say and stand their ground. The contrast between the naggers, who are constantly nagging, and Stray Kids, who yell what they have to say and are determined to make their own music, is stark.
