             intense words and phrases that represent devastation and hopelessness. Most believe that the song could be describing
             a trainee's difficult life or more specifically, the hell Stray Kids experienced as trainees.

                As the year passes and the future approaches, it contains a confident message to stop worrying and trust the new generation. It also recognizes the sincerity of people who want to youngsters to live a better life and not make the same mistakes as they did.
                The song resonates with the "kids these days" who are tired of hearing the same sermons every day, as well as with those who have walked the same path as us in the past. The song's title "Gone Days", which is a play on the word 꼰대 kkondae, also shows the sensibility of Stray Kids.

                The song was written and composed by member Changbin, who delivers a monologue about his childhood dreams. “As an adult, I'm far from the person I imagined myself to be in the past, but the song expresses my determination to be strong once again. Longing looks different for everyone. For some it's love, for others it's a dream or goal they want to achieve. Stray Kids sing ‘Mixtape : On Track’ with the sincerity of longing for something. The song's spoken-word rap, escalating emotions, and the final explosion of everything at the end complete Stray Kids' unique style.”

                This features the Korean versions of the opening song "TOP ("Tower of God" OST)" and the ending theme song "SLUMP ("Tower of God" OST)" from the Naver Webtoon anime Tower of God. Tower of God centers around a boy named Twenty-Fifth Bam. It is notable that in Korea 'Bam' can mean 'Night' or 'Chestnut'. He has spent most of his life trapped beneath a vast and mysterious Tower, with only his close friend, Rachel, to keep him company. When Rachel enters the Tower, Bam is devastated.

Really, the only thing that sets Sun Nyeo apart from every other teenage girl in the world is the fact that she holds an uncanny resemblance to the heroine of a romance comic popular more than a decade ago.

                “All In” literally goes all in, with its lyrics implying that Stray Kids will not give up or stop even when facing adversity. The lyrics are paired with high tempo beats to create the idea that this is a high-stakes game with a lot of risks. The MV has a scene where they talk to the media, and we are led to believe that they have been framed.

                The title "OH" refers to a child and at the same time means "愛 wo" (love). Using a word with a double meaning as the theme, they expressed their feelings of resentment and frustration at themselves for being clumsy and immature towards the person they like, and for constantly acting like a child when confronted to love. 3RACHA took full advantage of Stray Kids' unique yet soft and powerful charm. Unlike the addictive melody based on reggaeton rhythm, the lyrics that represent the anguished mind and the rap that is recited with no effort create a heterogeneous feeling.

                It reflects the stories of how both artists became the performers and people they are today. The chorus examines how life was challenging for both Lil Durk and Stray Kids, but it has motivated them to work harder to become the popular and well-known artists they are today. During Seungmin's seven years of training to debut as an idol, he had friends that either debuted, went to different companies, or left the music industry altogether– witnessing them come and go. He did not have anyone until the members of Stray Kids met him.

                The drama is an original suspense genre in which the ambition and vengeance of the main character swirls, and it is expected that Stray Kids' high-quality music will create synergy with the work. They created the song with a "dystopian" image of people running towards their goals, facing many obstacles and hindrances, but still having to move forward, and imagining it to be close to the worldview of the drama. We think the song is addictive because it uses a strong sound to express a strong attitude of moving forward without regard for others or their surroundings.

The repetitive melodic line of the chorus captures the breathless feeling, while the soft harmonies of Stray Kids and Charlie Puth add to the song's charm. The song features strong lyrics, contrasting emotional guitar arpeggios, and a catchy, minimalist synth lead.
