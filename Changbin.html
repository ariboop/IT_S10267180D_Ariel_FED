        <h2 class="head" class="box" style="color:#EFD3E7;">Personal Life</h2>
        <p class="head" class="box" style="font-size: large;">
            Seo Chang-bin was born on August 11, 1999 in Yongin and raised in Uiwang and Seoul. He went to Galmoe Elementary School.<br/>
            <br/>He graduated from Bora High School on February 6, 2018.<br/><br>He is currently enrolled at Gukje Cyber University under 
            the Department of Entertainment Studies.<br/><br/>On March 30, 2023, Changbin was appointed to The Promise's honors club as a 
            major donor for having donated over 100 million won to help the victims of the earthquakes in Turkey and Syria.

        <h2 class="head" class="box" style="color:#EFD3E7;">Trivia</h2>
        <p class="head" class="box" style="font-size: large;">
            He is a die hard fan of Samsung since debut and consistently promoted the brand over the years despite all the other members 
            having iPhones. Funnily enough, Changbin's dedication paid off when Stray Kids as a whole became models for Samsung's 
            accessory brand SLBS in 2023, forcing all the members to switch to Samsung phones.
        </p>

        <h2 class="head" class="box" style="color:#EFD3E7;">Artistry</h2>

        <p class="smallright" class="box" style="font-size: large;vertical-align: 50px;">
            Changbin's rap is recognizable to its scratchy feeling and intensity. His voice can switch from a deep, husky tone to a 
            nasally, high pitched tone, giving a rough feeling. He is known for having a very loud voice which can be heard easily even 
            without a microphone. His performance aspects include coolness, charisma and darkness. He used to have a rap tag, "YAW".<br/>
            <br/>Despite his gritty image, he has shown his ability to sing in a soft tone, and some songs feature melodic rap parts. His 
            own songs, like "Mixtape : On Track", tend to be more melodic.

        <h2 class="head" class="box" style="color:#EFD3E7;">Predebut</h2>   
        <p class="small" class="box" style="font-size: large;vertical-align: 20px">
            In 2016, Changbin joined JYP Entertainment through an audition with a self composed rap song. He formed a hip-hop crew called 
            3RACHA with trainees Bang Chan ("CB97") and Han Ji-sung ("J.One"), where he used the stage name "SPEARB". They uploaded 
            self-composed extended plays on SoundCloud throughout 2017.<br/><br/>His individual picture and name were officially revealed 
            for his participation in the upcoming survival show Stray Kids. He was introduced with the roles "Producer" and "Rap". On the 
            final episode of the show on December 19, 2017, it was confirmed that Changbin would debut with the boy group Stray Kids.

        <h2 class="head" class="box" style="color:#EFD3E7;"> Skzoo</h2>
        <img src="Images/dwaekki.webp" class="small" style="width:30%;">
        <p class="smallright" class="box" style="font-size: large;vertical-align: 90px;">
            DWAEKKI is Changbin's skzoo. DWAEKKI's design was inspired by Changbin's clay statue resembling a mixture of a pig and a 
            bunny he made during a variety broadcast.<br/><br/>It was called a "dwaekki", a contraction of 돼지 dwaeji ("pig") and 토끼 
            tokki ("rabbit").
