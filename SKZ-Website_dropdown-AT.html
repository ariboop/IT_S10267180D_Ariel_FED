            <h2 class="head" class="box">Their Logo</h2>
            <p class="head" class="box" style="font-size: large;">While their group name "Stray Kids" was given with no meaning behind it, the members
                 conceptualised it themselves. The name originally meant a lost child who wants to chase their dreams and evolved to represent the 
                 idea of finding a way out of the ordinary together.
            </p>
            <img src="Images/logo2.png" class="img" style="width:25%">
            <p class="head" class="box" style="font-size: large;">
                Here, the "SKZ" is meant to represent a keyhole, symbolsing the group's mission to unlock new possibilties and break down barriers in the 
                music industry. The Z stands for Zone, making SKZ literally mean Stray Kids Zone. It refers to a place or zone that metaphorically
                 means a place we're people like us, Stays, can lose ourselves and be who we are.
            </p>
            <h2></h2>
            <h2 class="head" class="box">The lightstick</h2>
            <img src="Images/light.jpg" class="img" style="width: 25%;">
            <p class="head" class="img" style="font-size: large;">
                The V1 of the light stick was released for Stray Kids's first concert,
                 as part of the world tour District 9 : Unlock in 2019. It is composed of a white handle with a crooked edge
                  symbolizing "unstable way", holding up a spinnable red and silver "compass without direction" symbolizing
                   "Stray Kids's way". It is a compass because a lot of Skz's music is about the struggles young people might 
                   have, and the broken compass might have symbolized that not everything is going to go the way you want it to go. 
                   Because of the broken compass, Skz had to go through many difficulties to get to their destination.
