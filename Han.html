        <h2 class="head" class="box" style="color:#FFB399;">Personal Life</h2>
        <p class="head" class="box" style="font-size: large;">
            Han Ji-sung was born on September 14, 2000 in Incheon, South Korea. At the age of 5, he moved to live in Mokpo where he 
            attended Okam Elementary School. It was his last school in Korea, as at the age of 9, he moved to Malaysia and enrolled 
            in Fairview International School, but eventually dropped out to be homeschooled.<br/><br/>In 2014, Ji-sung passed the 
            elementary and middle school exam. In 2015, he came to South Korea to pass the high school level exam to apply for colleges. 
            He made a deal with his parents that if he does not succeed in getting into an entertainment agency within a year, he would 
            go back to Malaysia to study. At the same time, he was taking dance, rap and vocal classes at D.E.F. Academy in Seoul.
            <br/><br/>A few days after passing the GED, Ji-sung auditioned for a company one morning with a friend, and he heard about 
            a JYP audition taking place as well. Eventually, they auditioned there as well, and Ji-sung auditioned with rapping. He 
            passed the first round and was asked to come for a second audition, after which he was accepted into JYP Entertainment.
            <br/><br/>In 2019, JYPE stated that HAN suffers from intermittent anxiety around an undetermined number of people.<br/><br/>
            He is currently enrolled at Gukje Cyber University under the Department of Entertainment Studies.

        <h2 class="head" class="box" style="color:#FFB399;">Inspiration</h2>
        <p class="head" class="box" style="font-size: large;">
            Hyunjin's dancing is known for its theatricality and control over his body movements and facial expressions. He showcases two distinct 
            dancing styles, switching swiftly and seamlessly from a fluid and relaxed style to a jerky and sharp style. He always gives his own 
            flair to the group's choreographies and easily draws attention. As such, he has become a key element for the performance aspect of 
            the group.<br/><br/>Hyunjin is also involved in choreography, especially for his solo dance covers such as "Play With Fire". He also 
            gives his input when it comes to the group's live performances. He participated in arranging the stage for the group version of "Red 
            Lights" and suggested to perform "GET LIT" at 2023 Asian Artist Awards to showcase something new.

        <h2 class="head" class="box" style="color:#FFB399;">Songwriting</h2>
        <p class="head" class="box" style="font-size: large;">
            His personal identity as an artist is quite different from that of Stray Kids. While he delivers his lines with spitting energy in 
            the group's hype songs, he likes to use lyrical genres in his own. He particularly likes rock, R&B and emo hip-hop . His solo songs 
            like "Alien" or those he writes for the group like "CHILL", are part of what the fans but also the members call the "HAN genre" or 
            "HANpop". They are recognizable songs, tackling personal and often melancholic subjects with figurative language. He said he 
            finds a lot of inspiration from animes and storylines he creates in his head.<br/><br/>HAN's songwriting is also prolific. He often 
            mentions having written a song from start to finish in a few hours, like "CHILL" and "Want so BAD", and talked about having over 
            thirty songs he discarded.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <h2 class="head" class="box" style="color:#FFB399;">Rap, vocals, dance</h2>
        <img id="Visual" src="Images/danceh.jpg" class="small" style="width:20%;">
        <p class="smallright" class="box" style="font-size: large;vertical-align: 50px;">
            HAN started off as a rapper and member of producer unit 3RACHA, but he broke the boundaries of positions multiple times. He 
            is in charge of high notes since the predebut song "Hellevator" and has shown vocal prowess on Stray Kids' performance of 
            "Pray (I'll Be Your Man)" at Kingdom: Legendary War. While not being a dancer, he is often noticed for his energy and facial 
            expressions on stage. HAN is called an all-rounder for being able to showcase equally good rap, vocal, and performance skills.

        <p class="small" class="box" style="font-size: large;vertical-align: 0px">
            In 2016, Ji-sung formed a hip hop crew called 3RACHA with trainees Bang Chan (CB97) and Seo Chang-bin (SPEARB), where he used 
            the stage name "J.ONE". They uploaded self-composed extended plays on SoundCloud throughout 2017.<br/><br/>Ji-sung's individual 
            picture and name were officially revealed for his participation in the upcoming survival show Stray Kids. He was introduced with 
            the roles "Rap", "Vocal" and "Producing". On the final episode of the show on December 19, 2017, it was confirmed that Ji-sung 
            would debut with the boy group Stray Kids.

            HAN QUOKKA is Han's skzoo. HAN QUOKKA's design was inspired by HAN being compared to a 
            squirrel or a quokka since debut because of his full cheeks.
