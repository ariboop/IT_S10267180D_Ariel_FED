        <h2 class="head" class="box" style="color:#6c7498;">Personal Life</h2>
        <p class="head" class="box" style="font-size: large;">
            Lee Felix Yong-bok was born to Korean immigrant parents on September 15, 2000 in Sydney, Australia. He grew up 
            in the Seven Hills suburb and completed his education at St Patrick's Marist College.<br/><br/>Felix arrived in
             South Korea on February 14, 2017.<br/><br/>In March 2022, JYP Entertainment announced that Felix was diagnosed with 
             disk herniation.<br/><br/>In November 2023, he participated in the "Love Your W" campaign by W Korea to raise awareness
             about breast cancer.<br/><br/>On January 4, 2024, it was announced that Felix had donated 100 million won to help Laos
             children suffering from poor sanitation and nutrition, becoming the youngest UNICEF Honors Club member and first member 
            of 2024. Later on February 7, Felix travelled to Laos on his free time to do volunteering work with children, which 
            was documented through the UNICEF series Login - Laos.<br/><br/>On September 15, Felix donated 50 million won to UNICEF 
            and World Vision each, to help underprivileged children in Laos and Korea. He was then appointed as a member of World Vision's 
            "Bob Pierce" donors club.<br/><br/>On September 23, Felix had been appointed as a goodwill ambassador for the UNICEF Korea comitee.

        <h2 class="head" class="box" style="color:#6c7498;">Artistry</h2>
        <p class="head" class="box" style="font-size: large;">
            Since debut, Felix is a hot topic for his cavernous voice which contrasts with his soft looks. He often talked about it as being the 
            "bass of the group" and it is a weapon for Stray Kids' hype image. His lines often become the killing parts of the song, like in 
            "Side Effects", "God's Menu" or "Christmas EveL", to the point that he is nicknamed "that part guy". When he sings, his voice gets 
            higher, softer and boyish, like in "Deep end", "Youtiful" or "FNF".<br/><br/>His dancing is characterized by his coolness and 
            freshness. He was often in charge of doing stunts in choreographies, like high kicks, as seen in "ALL IN" or "WOLFGANG".
        </p>

        <h2 class="head" class="box" style="color:#6c7498;"> Visuals</h2>
        <img src="Images/visualf.jpg" class="small" style="width:30%;">
        <p class="smallright" class="box" style="font-size: large;vertical-align: 50px;">
            Felix is part of the visual line along Lee Know and Hyunjin. Visually, he has a soft fairy, elf-like image. 
            He has had a great diversity of hair colors and makeup styles which often get experimental, like hair extensions 
            ("Thunderous") and white mascara and eyebrows ("TOP").<br/><br/>He is also known for his freckles which used to be 
            hidden by makeup artists earlier in the group's career, but are now almost always shown due to the good response from fans.
        </p>

        <h2 class="head" class="box" style="color:#6c7498;">Predebut</h2>   
        <p class="small" class="box" style="font-size: large;vertical-align: 0px">
            Felix was scouted through a Facebook dm message he received after school, asking him if he was interested in 
            auditioning for JYP Entertainment. He auditioned with a freestyle dance. He became the 6th member to join the lineup.<br/>
            <br/>His individual picture and name were 
            officially revealed for his participation in the upcoming survival show Stray Kids. He was introduced with the 
            roles Rap and Dance.<br/><br/>During the show, he was eliminated 
            on episode 8 because of his struggle with Korean language, but he was brought back.Following the audience voting
             in favor of the 9-member lineup, it was confirmed that Felix would debut with 
            the boy group Stray Kids.

        <h2 class="head" class="box" style="color:#6c7498;"> Skzoo</h2>
        <img src="Images/bbokari.webp" class="small" style="width:30%;">
        <p class="smallright" class="box" style="font-size: large;vertical-align: 90px;">
            BbokAri is Felix's Skzoo. BbokAri's design was inspired by Felix being compared to a chick for his cuteness and 
            bright personality.<br/><br/>His name is a combination of 복 bok from 용복 yongbok (Felix' Korean name) and 병아리 byeongari ("chick").
