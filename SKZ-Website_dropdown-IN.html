        <h2 class="head" class="box" style="color:#f9777a;">Personal Life</h2>
        <p class="head" class="box" style="font-size: large;">Yang Jeongin was born on February 8, 2001 in Busan, South Korea. 
            In middle school, he realized he enjoyed singing and started going on auditions in 8th grade.<br/><br/> In November 2017, he 
            was accepted at SOPA (School of Performing Art) in Applied Music and Vocal. He graduated on February 5, 2021.
             On June 7, 2024, it was announced that I.N had donated 100 million won to Childfund Korea to help improving the
              health of underprivileged children in South Korea, and was appointed as a member of the "Green Noble" donors club.
        </p>

        <h2 class="head" class="box" style="color:#f9777a;">Vocals</h2>
        <p class="head" class="box" style="font-size: large;">I.N's role as a vocalist has been steadily improving. His vocal 
            tone is quite unique sounding and has an elegant feeling to it, due to his background in trot singing. It fits bright 
            songs, but also ballads and the pouring of emotions. He sometimes sings high parts like in "Chronosaurus".<br/><br/> While 
            his lines were fewer at debut, he got more of them as time passed by. He often gets pre-choruses and bridges.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <h2 class="head" class="box" style="color:#f9777a;"> Visuals</h2>
        <img src="Images/visualin.jpg" class="small" style="width:30%;">
        <p class="smallright" class="box" style="font-size: large;vertical-align: 50px;">
            Due to being the maknae, I.N has a cute and bubbly image, and is also known to have a big bright smile. However,
             his resting face is colder and he has features like his jaw and eyebrow bones which are sharp and masculine. As 
             he grew up into his looks and started working out, he has become more mature looking overall. In recent years, 
             I.N wants to showcase a sexier image of himself, as shown with his solo stage "HALLUCINATION".
        </p>

        <h2 class="head" class="box" style="color:#f9777a;">Predebut</h2>   
        <p class="small" class="box" style="font-size: large;vertical-align: 40px">
            Jeongin auditioned for JYP Entertainment when the company came to Busan and he was accepted after the second try.
             <br/> <br/>His individual picture and name were officially revealed by the company on October 13, 2017 at noon, for 
             his participation in the upcoming survival show Stray Kids. He was introduced with the role "Vocal". On the 
             final episode of the show on December 19, 2017, it was confirmed that Jeongin would debut with the boy group Stray Kids.
